        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first=5:
                  The number of randomly selected Input Unit
                  connestions which the first Dense Level's
                  Units will make to randomly selected Input
                  units per input unit. In other words if
                  there are n input units, each first Level
                  Dense unit will select predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first * n
                  InputUnits to connect to (WITH REPLACEMENT).
                  Hence this may be > 1, as a given
                  InputUnit may be chosen multiple times.
                  For example, with this set to 5, and where
                  were 2 connections, then each Dense
                  unit will make 10 connections to randomly
                  selected Input Units. If there were
                  10 inputs, and this were set to 0.5, then
                  the each Dense unit on the first layer would
                  connect to 5 randomly selected InputUnits.
        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first_rounding_rule='ceil':

                  Dense unit on the first layer makes is
                  [number of InputUnits] *  predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first,
                  then this will usually come out to a floating
                  point number. The number of upstream
                  connections to make is a discrete variable,
                  so this float must be cast as an integer.
                  This supports "floor" and "ceil" as the
                  options with "ceil" as the recommended
                  option, because it can never ruturn 0,
                  which would throw and error
                  (It would create a disjointed graph).
        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main=0.7:
                  For the second and subsequent DenseLevels,
                  if its immediate predecessor level has
                  n DenseUnits, the DenseUnits on this layer will randomly select
                  predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main * n
                  DenseUnits form its immediate predecessor
                  Level to connect to. The selection is
                  WITH REPLACEMENT and a given DenseUnit may
                  be selected multiple times.
        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main_rounding_rule='ceil':
                  The number of connections calculated by
                  predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main * n
                  will usually come out to a floating point
                  the number of DenseUnits  in its predecessor
                  Level to connect to is a discrete variable,
                  hence this must be cast to an integer. The
                  options to do this are "floor" and "ceil",
                  with "ceil" being the generally recommended
                  option, as it will never return 0. 0 will
                  create a disjointed graph and throw an error.
        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_decay_main=lambda x: 0.7 * x:
                  It is likely that the connections with the
                  imemdiate predecessor, grandparent, and
                  great - grandparent predecessors will be more
                  (or less) infuential than more distant
                  predecessors. This parameter allows any
                  function that accepts an integer and returns

                  The number of randomly selected Input Unit
                  connestions which the first Dense Level's
                  Units will make to randomly selected Input
                  units per input unit. In other words if
                  there are n input units, each first Level
                  Dense unit will select predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first * n
                  InputUnits to connect to (WITH REPLACEMENT).
                  Hence this may be > 1, as a given
                  InputUnit may be chosen multiple times.
                  For example, with this set to 5, and where
                  were 2 connections, then each Dense
                  unit will make 10 connections to randomly
                  selected Input Units. If there were
                  10 inputs, and this were set to 0.5, then
                  the each Dense unit on the first layer would
                  connect to 5 randomly selected InputUnits.
        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first_rounding_rule='ceil':
                  Since the numnber of randomly selected
                  connections to an InputUnit that a given
                  Dense unit on the first layer makes is
                  [number of InputUnits] *  predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first,
                  then this will usually come out to a floating
                  point number. The number of upstream
                  connections to make is a discrete variable,
                  so this float must be cast as an integer.
                  This supports "floor" and "ceil" as the
                  options with "ceil" as the recommended
                  option, because it can never ruturn 0,
                  which would throw and error
                  (It would create a disjointed graph).
        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main=0.7:
                  For the second and subsequent DenseLevels,
                  if its immediate predecessor level has
                  n DenseUnits, the DenseUnits on this layer will randomly select
                  predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main * n
                  DenseUnits form its immediate predecessor
                  Level to connect to. The selection is
                  WITH REPLACEMENT and a given DenseUnit may
                  be selected multiple times.
        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main_rounding_rule='ceil':
                  The number of connections calculated by
                  predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main * n
                  will usually come out to a floating point
                  the number of DenseUnits  in its predecessor
                  Level to connect to is a discrete variable,
                  hence this must be cast to an integer. The
                  options to do this are "floor" and "ceil",
                  with "ceil" being the generally recommended
                  option, as it will never return 0. 0 will
                  create a disjointed graph and throw an error.
        predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_decay_main=lambda x: 0.7 * x:
                  It is likely that the connections with the
                  imemdiate predecessor, grandparent, and
                  great - grandparent predecessors will be more
                  (or less) infuential than more distant
                  predecessors. This parameter allows any
                  function that accepts an integer and returns
                  a floating point or integer to be used to
                  decrease (or increase) the number of
