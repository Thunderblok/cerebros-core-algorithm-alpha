                                  keras activation for dense unit
                 number_of_architecture_moities_to_try: int: defaults to 7,
                                  The auto-ml will select this many
                                  permutations of architectural moities, in
                                  other words (number of levels, number of
                                  Units or Dense Layers per level for each
                                  level.
                 minimum_skip_connection_depth: int: defaults to 1,
                                  The DenseLevels will be randomly connected
                                  to others in Levels below it. These
                                  connections will not be made exclusively to
                                  DenseUnits in its immediate successor Level.
                                  Some may be 2,3,4,5, ... Levels down. This
                                  parameter controls the minimum depth of

                 maximum_skip_connection_depth: int: defaults to 7,
                                  The DenseLevels will be randomly connected
                                  to others in Levels below it. These
                                  connections will not be made exclusively to
                                  DenseUnits in its immediate successor Level.
                                  Some may be 2,3,4,5, ... Levels down. This
                                  parameter controls the minimum depth of
                                  connection allowed for connections not at
                                  the immediate successor Level.
                 predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first: int: defaults to 5,
                                  The number of randomly selected Input Unit
                                  connestions which the first Dense Level's
                                  Units will make to randomly selected Input
                                  units per input unit. In other words if
                                  there are n input units, each first Level
                                  Dense unit will select predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first * n
                                  InputUnits to connect to (WITH REPLACEMENT).
                                  Hence this may be > 1, as a given
                                  InputUnit may be chosen multiple times.
                                  For example, with this set to 5, and where
                                  were 2 connections, then each Dense
                                  unit will make 10 connections to randomly
                                  selected Input Units. If there were
                                  10 inputs, and this were set to 0.5, then
                                  the each Dense unit on the first layer would
                                  connect to 5 randomly selected InputUnits.
                 predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first_rounding_rule: str: defaults to 'ceil',
                                  Since the numnber of randomly selected
                                  connections to an InputUnit that a given
                                  Dense unit on the first layer makes is
                                  [number of InputUnits] *  predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_first,
                                  then this will usually come out to a floating
                                  point number. The number of upstream
                                  connections to make is a discrete variable,
                                  so this float must be cast as an integer.
                                  This supports "floor" and "ceil" as the
                                  options with "ceil" as the recommended
                                  option, because it can never ruturn 0,
                                  which would throw and error
                                  (It would create a disjointed graph).
                 predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main: float: defaults to 0.7,
                                  For the second and subsequent DenseLevels,
                                  if its immediate predecessor level has
                                  n DenseUnits, the DenseUnits on this layer will randomly select
                                  predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main * n
                                  DenseUnits form its immediate predecessor
                                  Level to connect to. The selection is
                                  WITH REPLACEMENT and a given DenseUnit may
                                  be selected multiple times.
                 predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main_rounding_rule: str: defaults to 'ceil',
                                 The number of connections calculated by
                                 predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main * n
                                 will usually come out to a floating point
   21-add-a-way-to-get-the-best-model                              the number of DenseUnits  in its predecessor
                                 Level to connect to is a discrete variable,
                                 hence this must be cast to an integer. The
                                 options to do this are "floor" and "ceil",
                                 with "ceil" being the generally recommended
                                 option, as it will never return 0. 0 will
                                 create a disjointed graph and throw an error.
                 predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_decay_main: object: defaults to zero_7_exp_decay,
                                 It is likely that the connections with the
                                 imemdiate predecessor, grandparent, and
                                 great - grandparent predecessors will be more
                                 (or less) infuential than more distant
                                 predecessors. This parameter allows any
                                 function that accepts an integer and returns
                                 a floating point or integer to be used to
                                 decrease (or increase) the number of
                                 connections made between the k th layer and
                                 its nthe predecessor, where n = 1 is its
                                 GRANDPARENT predecesor level, and n-2 is its great - grandparent level. What this does exactly: The kth layer will make
                                 predecessor_level_connection_affinity_factor_main
                 seed: int: defaults to 8675309,
                 max_consecutive_lateral_connections: int: defaults to 7,
                                 The maximum number of consecutive Units on a Level that make
                                 a lateral connection. Setting this too high can cause exploding /
                                 vanishing gradients and internal covariate shift. Setting this too
                                 low may miss some patterns the network may otherwise pick up.
                 gate_after_n_lateral_connections: int: defaults to 3,
                                 After this many kth consecutive lateral connecgtions, gate the
                                 output of the k + 1 th DenseUnit before creating a subsequent
                                 lateral connection.
                 gate_activation_function: object: defaults to simple_sigmoid,
                                 Which activation function to gate the output of one DenseUnit
                                 before making a lateral connection.
                 p_lateral_connection: float: defaults to 0.97,
                                 The probability of the first given DenseUnit on a level making a
                                 lateral connection with the second DenseUnit.
                 p_lateral_connection_decay: object: defaults to zero_95_exp_decay,
                                 A function that descreases or increases the probability of a
                                 lateral connection being made with a subsequent DenseUnit.
                                 Accepts an unsigned integer x. returns a floating point number that
                                 will be multiplied by p_lateral_connection where x is the number
                                 of subsequent connections after the first
