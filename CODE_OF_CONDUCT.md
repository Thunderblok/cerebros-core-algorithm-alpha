# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, and ethical use of our technology, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience and protect the community and society for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation from any behavior that is inconsistent with the values listed in our license.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the global community at large
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Behavior that is demeaning, degrading, or otherwise creates a hostile environment for any reason
* Any behavior that demonstrates a failure to allign with Cerebros' values of social justice and ethical 
  standards of busienss, regardless of location, context, or organbization in which they took place. For example, advocating for the use of AI to contribute to socially unjust pracvtices prohibited by our license agreement.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces, in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community and in general, and 
even when not representing Cerebros. Given the magnitude of impact that Cerebros has, 
we bear a greater responsibility to society than maintainers of many projects. Given this, 
we reserve the right to limit who is allowed to participate based on character in general.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, as
well as any behavior at any time that can agversely affect the reputation of Cerebros may be
reported by contacting the project team at david@cerebros.one. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
